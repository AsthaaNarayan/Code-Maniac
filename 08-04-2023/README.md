1. Regular Expression Matching

Hard

Given an input string s and a pattern p, implement regular expression matching with support for '.' and '*' where:

'.' Matches any single character.

'*' Matches zero or more of the preceding element.

The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).

Inputs :
- s = "aa", p = "a*"
- s = "ab", p = ".*"

Expected Output :
- True Or False

2. Number of Closed Islands

Medium

Given a 2D grid consists of 0s (land) and 1s (water).  An island is a maximal 4-directionally connected group of 0s and a closed island is an island totally (all left, top, right, bottom) surrounded by 1s.

Return the number of closed islands.

Inputs :
- [[0,0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,1,0],[0,1,1,1,0]]
- [[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0],[1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0],[1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0],[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0]]

Expected Output :
- number of islands

3. Add Two Numbers

Easy

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

Inputs :
- l1 = [2,4,6] , l2 = [3,5,6]
- l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]

Expected Output :
- Single list as the sum
